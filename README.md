Hi there, my name is Jonathan Gilman and I am a first year Master of Environmental Management student at Duke University.

Within my degree I am concentrating in Environmental Analytics & Modeling and Terrestrial & Freshwater Ecosystems. I’m passionate about using data to better understand freshwater systems — from stream chemistry and nutrient cycling to watershed-scale management.
